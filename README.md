# Digger (OpenTACO) PoC

Set up [Digger](https://docs.digger.dev/ce/getting-started/with-terraform) to automate terraform pull requests using GitHub Actions

Optionally:
- setup Infracost as a part of CI/CD workflow https://www.infracost.io/docs/integrations/cicd/
- setup Checkov checks (security analysis) as a part of CI/CD workflow https://docs.opentaco.dev/ce/howto/using-checkov

## Pre-commit hooks
Git [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks are scripts that run automatically before a commit is finalized. They are used to enforce code quality, style, or other checks before changes are saved to the repository.

### Installation and usage
1) Install pre-commit Python package:
```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

or
```bash
brew install pre-commit
```

2) In the root of Git repository, create a file named `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (already created).
3) Define your hooks in the YAML file.
4) Install the hooks:
```bash
pre-commit install
```
This command will set up the necessary Git hook scripts in `.git/hooks` to run the hooks defined in your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
5) Manually run hooks
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```
6) Depending on hooks configured, you might need to install additional packages/dependencies, e.g.:
```bash
brew install terraform-docs tflint tfsec infracost tfupdate jq
```
